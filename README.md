# tomcat-systemd-setup

A simple, production-style setup to deploy a Java `.war` application using Apache Tomcat and `systemd` on a Linux server. This repository provides a sample `.war` file and a custom `tomcat.service` unit to manage Tomcat as a background service.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Ensure the following before proceeding:

- A Debian/Ubuntu-based Linux system (other distros also work with minor changes)

## üõ† Installation Steps

### 1. Install Java (if not already installed)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk -y
java -version
```

### 2. Download and Set Up Apache Tomcat

  ```bash
    wget https://downloads.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-10/v10.1.11/bin/apache-tomcat-10.1.11.tar.gz
    tar -xzf apache-tomcat-10.1.11.tar.gz
    sudo mv apache-tomcat-10.1.11 /opt/tomcat
    sudo chmod +x /opt/tomcat/bin/*.sh
  ```

### 3. Deploy Sample WAR Application

  ```bash
    sudo cp sample.war /opt/tomcat/webapps/
  ```

### 4. Configure systemd Service

  ```bash
   sudo cp tomcat.service /etc/systemd/system/
    sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable tomcat
    sudo systemctl start tomcat
  ```

### 5.Verify Deployment

  Open your browser and go to:
      ```bash
      http://<your-server-ip>:8080/sample/
      ```
  Check service status:
       ```bash
       sudo systemctl status tomcat
       ```

### Notes
  Ensure port 8080 is open in your firewall.
  WAR files are automatically deployed to /opt/tomcat/webapps/.
  Logs are available at /opt/tomcat/logs/.
